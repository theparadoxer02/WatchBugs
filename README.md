*All these things in a very instant time.*


# Motivation to make the project

While learning Django and solving competitive programming questions,many time I used to stuck at some place and
i really need the *instant help* from my friends to solve and debug the code . So for that Instant help and the
*small code* one should not use the big platforms like **stackoverflow** for asking stupid questions.There were other means like
pastebin but these do not provide the differentiate between the code, bug and comment feature.

With this platform i was able to send bug that came in the terminal, along with the code , also write about what I did ,
where should he look into, what methodology did i used to solve it by describing  in comment section.


## Key Features:-

1. **Django REST FRAMEWORK**
2. **CRUD (CREATE , VIEW , UPDATE , DELETE)**
3. **Unique Id with each paste**
